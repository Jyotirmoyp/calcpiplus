# calcpiplus

These two scripts can be useful to run calcpi code (Written by Clint Conrad, https://www.clintconrad.no/mantleflow/mantleflow.html) to calculate
instanteneous strecting axes from the global geodynamic flow.

The code has two parts. 

precalcpi produces required input for in.calcpi.inexv and in.findnn.

post calcpi processes the results from calcpi. To run postcalcpi, you may need a code 'oneline' (by Thorsten Becker) in case you are running in a loop. Modify the loop accordingly, and oneline may not be required.
