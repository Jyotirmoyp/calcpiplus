# calcpiplus

This two scripts can be useful to run calcpi code (Written by Clint Conrad, https://www.clintconrad.no/mantleflow/mantleflow.html) to calculate
instanteneous strecting axes from the global geodynamic flow.

The code has two parts. 

precalcpi produces required input for in.calcpi.inexv and in.findnn.

post calcpi processes the results from calcpi.
